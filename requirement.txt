 Let me discuss with you  about your requirement further if you are online ,


We need some clean-up work done primarily on the modeling of the building. The items we need to be cleaned up are as follows:
-Lean-to pitch needs to be set to default of 1
-Lean-to-pitch and roof-pitch need to be separate, right now they are tied together. We need to be able to change the pitch on both independently.
-Some lean-to’s lose the trim profile when changing the pitch (when the pitch is changed the trim goes away).
-Roof and lean-to colors/patterns look a little different - They need to be the same
-Side overhangs have a line that separates the overhang of the roof - this needs to be removed to look continuous
-Pitch, width, and trim on some lean-to’s (right lean-to, for example, aren’t working together - it gets crazy when adjusting the size of those together)
-Add door color options to match the existing colors for walls, etc…
I don’t think the would take very long for someone with your expertise. If you are interested, I would like to talk further and provide more details about the project.
